# Project-FishingApp
The application that I will be creating is a fishing app.




 # Overview
 My app will consist of the best kinds of fish to go out and catch in the top 10-15 states in the United States. It will also give the user the capability to check the weather the day of which they want to go out and cast!

 As the creator, I will build a platform that makes it very easy and simple for anyone to not just browse through the app but get wonderful information about the fish itself.

 # User-Stories
